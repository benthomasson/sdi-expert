# CLAUDE.md

## Domain

This is a code expert knowledge base for **System Design Interview implementations**.

**Target repository:** `/Users/ben/git/sdi-implementations`

## Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `entries/` | Chronological code exploration entries |
| `beliefs.md` | Belief registry (read-only view, generated from reasons) |
| `reasons.db` | Primary belief store (SQLite, gitignored) |
| `network.json` | Portable export of reasons network (committed) |
| `nogoods.md` | Tracked contradictions between beliefs |
| `.code-expert/` | Tool state (topic queue, config) |

## Workflow

1. Scan the repo to identify key files (`code-expert scan`)
2. Explore topics in the queue (`code-expert explore`)
3. Explain specific files/functions as needed (`code-expert explain file ...`)
4. Propose beliefs from accumulated entries (`code-expert propose-beliefs`)
5. Review proposals for quality (`code-expert review-proposals`)
6. Accept reviewed beliefs (`code-expert accept-beliefs`)
7. Derive deeper reasoning chains (`code-expert derive --auto`)
8. Check for stale beliefs periodically (`reasons check-stale`)

For ongoing tracking, run `code-expert update --since-last` to do all of the above automatically and generate a morning summary.

# Belief pipeline
code-expert propose-beliefs          # extract proposals
code-expert propose-beliefs --auto   # auto-accept all (skip review)
code-expert propose-beliefs --since 2026-04-01  # only recent entries
code-expert review-proposals         # LLM quality filter
code-expert accept-beliefs
code-expert derive --auto            # single round
code-expert derive --exhaust         # loop until no new derivations
reasons check-stale
reasons compact

# Automated update pipeline
code-expert update --since-last      # walk commits + propose + derive + summary
